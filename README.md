High-Low_Number_Guessing
========================

This game chooses a random number between 1 and 100 and the player then tries to guess this number. If the number they guess is too low, the program will output “too low” and if it is too high it will output “too high”. The player wins when they guess the correct number. The limit on wrong guesses is 10.
